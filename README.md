- **Description**: Represents the description of a todo item.
- **Tag**: Represents a tag associated with a todo item.
- **TodoItem**: Represents a todo item.
- **TodoList**: Manages a list of todo items.

### `src/parser.rs`

This file contains functions for parsing commands and inputs.

### `src/query.rs`

This file contains the logic for querying and searching todo items.

### `src/runner.rs`

This file contains the main logic for running the application.

### `tests/`

This directory contains test files for various modules of the application.
 
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)

### Building the Project

```sh
cargo build
```

### Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:

```sh
cargo run
```

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```sh
cargo test
```

## Usage

The application supports the following commands:

- `add`: Add a new todo item.
- `search`: Search for todo items based on words and tags.
- `done`: Mark a todo item as completed.
  
### Adding a Todo Item

To add a new todo item, use the following command:

```sh
add "Buy groceries"  #shopping, #groceries
```

### Searching for Todo Items

To search for todo items, use the following command:

```sh
search groceries
```

### Marking a Todo Item as Done

To mark a todo item as completed, use the following command:

```sh
done 0
```

> [!NOTE]  
> After running cargo run, always first enter the number that represents how many commands you want to run. 
> ```sh
> 3
> add "Buy groceries"  #shopping, #groceries
> search groceries
> done 0
> ```
> This will add a todo item, search for todo items with the tag "groceries", and mark the first item as done.
